# Recommended Action
- The highly monthly spend that churn customer have is likely because they were given an expensive product from the start. What the company can do is give the newer customer a not so expensive product.
- Most of the customer churn just before 5 months. This likely due to how expensive the product is and they also don't find it worth for that kind of price. What the company can do is create a more cheaper product but also have a worth it product.
- The highly monthly spend that the customer spend only get them a video product. What the company can do is create a bundle or promo for other product aswell, not just video product. For example, a video and music product or video and education product, etc.
